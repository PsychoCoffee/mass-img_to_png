# Mass Image Converter to .png
![](https://github.com/PsychoCoffee/mass-img_to_png/blob/main/banner_mi.png)
This python script can be used to convert a massive folder of random image formats (such as .jpeg, .tiff, .tif, .jpg, .bmp) to .png files.

# How it works
It uses a for loop to loop through all the files in the folder, and if the file type matches to one of the supported convertable file types, it changes its file type to ".png"

# How to run
You can run this in Python IDLE or Python 3.10 by just double clicking on it. You might need to run Command Prompt as admin, and then run `pip install opencv-python` to install opencv2 and be able to run it
